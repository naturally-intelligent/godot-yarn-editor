# godot-yarn-editor
An editor for Yarn files built in Godot 4

## Why

Can't seem to find just a basic editor that isn't in a browser..
And also works with my yarn custom mods...
As text-edited yarn files get larger and larger, the need for visualization also grows...

So the plan is to make a visual editor so that we can see broken/dead end paths, etc,
while also keeping text-friendly manual editing at the forefront of any saves.

Another feature planned is algorithms for auto-arrangement of trees.

## Godot

This will not be meant as an addon for Godot, just a stand-alone yarn editing app.

Godot is just the framework for the app, but in the future, turning it into addon should be easy if warranted.

## Status

Loads basic yarn files and generates initial thread boxes, drag/drop and resize. Still very early!
